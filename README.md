# Advent of Code

This repository contains my answers for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.
There is a year and day directory for each respective puzzle.
Inside each puzzle's directory is code for each part and the inputs.
The code assumes the input is fed through STDIN.
Therefore, to run a puzzle, simply do:

```bash
./part-1.cr < input.txt
```

The `example.txt` file is the sample input everyone is provided in the puzzle text.
The `input.txt` file is my input for the same puzzle.
There may be other text files for test cases.

As of now, all puzzles solutions are written in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).
